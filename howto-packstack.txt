Installation Summary

You can install OpenStack with a few simple commands:

yum install centos-release-openstack-ocata

yum install openstack-packstack

packstack --gen-answer-file=/root/answers.txt

packstack --answer-file=/root/answers.txt (takes 10-15 minutes, depending on Internet speed)

An important part of the installation is the answer file. This long file contains a long list of parameters that need to be configured to determine what is going to be installed and how it will be installed. Below is a list of some of the parameters I'd recommend that you change to get to a simple POC setup.

CONFIG_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=password

CONFIG_SWIFT_INSTALL=n

CONFIG_HEAT_INSTALL=y

CONFIG_NTP_SERVERS=pool.ntp.org

CONFIG_KEYSTONE_ADMIN_PW=password

CONFIG_CINDER_VOLUMES_CREATE=y

CONFIG_HORIZON_SSL=y

CONFIG_HEAT_CFN_INSTALL=y

CONFIG_PROVISION_DEMO=n

CONFIG_NEUTRON_OVS_TUNNEL_IF=eth1

Verifying the Installation

Once the Packstack based installation has finished, you'll want to figure out if it was successful. A few simple commands can help you verify your installation. To start with, use source Ëœ/keystonerc_admin. This command sources the OpenStack credentials file that has automatically been created. This file authenticates you with Keystone, the OpenStack authentication service, after which you'll have full access to all of the OpenStack components and you'll be able to run the different OpenStack commands.

Another useful command is openstack-status (you'll need to install the openstack-utils RPM). After sourcing the credentials file, it gives an overview of the complete configuration that's currently operational. You can also use the OpenStack command-line interface. The openstack command from the CLI has hundreds of options to allow you to manipulate all parts of OpenStack. Type, for example:

openstack user list 
which will show a list of users currently configured in your OpenStack cloud.

After verifying that OpenStack has been configured successfully, you can also start a browser and connect to the Horizon configuration interface. 
This is a nice graphical interface that gives easy access to most of the tasks that OpenStack admins need to do on a frequent 
basis.

BELOW had to be done also:

This reminds me of https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.... : could you see if you have "ServerAlias" defined in /etc/httpd/conf.d/openstack-dashboard.conf or etc/httpd/conf.d/15-horizon_vhost.conf ? Removing them altogether, or adding ServerAlias and restarting httpd should help I think.

That did the trick, thank you so much! I added a ServerAlias line to /etc/httpd/conf.d/15-horizon_vhost.conf that was the public DNS name of my server. Working like a charm. :)
